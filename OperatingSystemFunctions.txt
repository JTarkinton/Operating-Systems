One of the most important basic functions of an operating system is the management of all the computer's internal and external hardware. 
The operating system controls all connected devices, telling them how to operate and interact. 
The results of said operations and interactions are the basic performance of the computer.
Some examples of the hardware that the operating system controls include the hard disk, optical drives, video cards and external port controllers, such as USB ports.
